# The-Effect-Technical-Indicators-in-Price-Movement-Prediction

Automated trading is becoming more and more popular. The rise of new data processing techniques and
computing capabilities ensures that trading strategies are continuously evolving. In this study, we assess the
importance of typical trading indicators of manual traders, to see whether they can still give a competitive
edge in the market of today. We use these trading indicators as input data into various classification models
to predict whether the following day will generate positive or negative returns for a stock. The models are
assessed on data from the 1960s up to the present time. We limited our scope to the top 100 most traded
stocks, and drew conclusions using modern explainability techniques to evaluate the models.
